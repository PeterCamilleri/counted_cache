# MakeGem

The counted_cache class. A cache for use in cases where data is mostly only
read and where the cost of rebuilding that data is high, and yet, the size
of the data is too large to keep all of it in RAM all of the time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'counted_cache'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install counted_cache
