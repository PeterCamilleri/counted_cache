# CountedCache

The counted_cache gem. A cache for use in cases where data is mostly only
read and where the cost of rebuilding that data is high, and yet, the size
of the data is too large to keep all of it in RAM all of the time.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'counted_cache'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install counted_cache

## Usage

Creating a counted cache is as simple as:

```ruby
cache_on_hand = CountedCache.new(10) {|key| retrieve_data_for(key) }
```

Where:

* The argument is the optional cache depth, which is the number of data
items kept in the cache.
* The required block is used to fetch the data associated with the key when
that data is needed, but not currently in the cache.

So how do we use a counted cache to get at our data? That is really simple:

```ruby
data = cache_on_hand[key]
```

That's it! And that is the complete essentials guide. There are a very few
extras to determine how well the cache is working. The hits and misses
properties record how many times the data was found in the cache (a hit) and
how many times it had to be retrieved (a miss).

### Example

Consider the case of an application that uses embedded ruby (erb) files. This
could look like:

```ruby
erb_cache = CountedCache.new {|name| ERB.new(IO.read(name))}

# Other code omitted.

view_text = erb_cache["my_file.html.erb"].result(a_binding)
```

The benchmark in the demo folder examines just such a scenario.
